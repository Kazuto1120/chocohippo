Project UniverseMalin is designed to be a multiplayer boss fight game where the players will play as a white blood cell and will be tasked with defending the human body from virus, bacteria, and other harmful invaders. This game's ultimate goal is to serve as a way for friends and families to connect with one another through a fun and relaxing experience that throws in just a touch of learning within.
For this project we have decided to use Unity as our main game engine to help us create this game due to the fact that Unity is relatively easy to learn to operate. Being one of the most popular game engines in the market, Unity provides its users with an asset store where users can download assets from other users to make it easy for people to create their dream game without needing experience in creating character models. This is also great for since due to the time constraint of this project, we will most likely be unable to create our own original character model. Another important aspect of our game is that it will most likely be a multiplayer game. Unity also offers us many options to help us implement this feature such using the Netcode SDK that is provided by the unity engine or using the third party ones that are offered in unity asset stores such as Photon Fusion and Fishnet.
